# Simple Website

## About
I felt like building a website; so I built one.
It took me around 9 hours for this first copycat version. 
I learned a lot: HTML, CSS and domain hosting. 
In this directory is the commented code for my website. 
The hope is that in the future I will be able to create
websites for anything that should warrant one very 
quickly.

## Credit 
I followed the teamtreehouse [How to Make a Website](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)
course start to finish. It was very, very well done.
Thank you. 

## What I learned (more below)
* Beginner level HTML
* Beginner level CSS
* Mobile First design
* Domain name and hosting basics
* Good Coding Practices

## Resources 
* [Treehouse course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is great for learning HTML and CSS basics
* w3 has a [html verifier ](https://validator.w3.org/)for checking for bugs in your html
* and a [css verifier](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) as well
* check your design and functionality on multiple devices with [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/#)
* buy a domain name at [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
* and host your code at [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/)

## Directory Structure
* HTML is in the main directory
* css is in the /css directory
* images are in the /img directory

## For Future Use
All structures in the code are commented and explained.
In the future I want to use this as a template and example.
However not every line of code is commented. Normally the 
first example will be explained and then not for the duration.

## Learnings (expanded)
### Shortcuts
* Moving around your ide with fn key
* Quick commenting with sht + /

### Mobile First Design approach
* Easier start with simplest and move towards complexity
* How screen width affects design ideas

### Copy + Paste 
* Most of your code on multiple pages will be very
similar. No need to waste time.

1. Buy domain name
2. Connect domain name to hosting service
